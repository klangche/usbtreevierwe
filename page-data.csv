Mac Apple Silicon (all models),5,3,3,2,3,5,4,7,Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)<br>has a built-in hub per USB-C port (consumes 1 tier). Practical limit: built-in hub + 2 external hubs + device. Less is more unfortunate due to apple silicon implementation.
Mac Intel,7,5,5,3,4,4,4,8,Intel Macs support deeper chains (7 tiers). Use powered hubs or Thunderbolt docks for multi-device setups.
PC x86/x64,7,5,5,3,4,4,4,8,xHCI supports 5 hubs per spec; practical limits are often around 4 external hubs due to endpoint constraints. Recommended is powered hubs for multiple devices.
PC ARM,6,4,4,2,3,3,3,6,ARM PCs follow standard xHCI limits but may have specific controller limitations depending on hardware vendor.
Linux x86/x64,6,4,4,2,4,4,4,7,"Linux follows xHCI spec but is limited by kernel endpoint allocation; ARM systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi) may have tighter limits."

iOS USB-C – iPhone,4,2,2,1,2,3,3,5, Less is more unfortunate due to apple silicon implementation.
iOS Lightning – iPhone,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,iPhone Lightning devices have limited hub support; avoid deep hub chains for reliable operation. Avoid if possible.
